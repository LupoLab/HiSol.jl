Calculate the minimum distance between the exit of an HCF with radius `a` and a mirror
with damage threshold `LIDT` to avoid damage for a pulse at wavelength `λ0` with a given `energy`.
The maximum fluence is taken as `LIDT/S_fluence` for safety.

    `LIDT` must be given in SI units, i.e. J/m²

# Some example values for `LIDT`:
- Newport ultrafast silver: 0.12 J/cm² = 1200 J/m²
- Thorlabs protected silver: 0.225 J/cm² = 2250 J/m²
- Layertec fs-optimised protected silver: 0.38 J/cm² = 3800 J/m²
- High-power mirror for sub-picosecond pulses: 0.75 J/cm² = 7500 J/m²
- High-LIDT mirror for Ti:Sapph pulses: 1 J/cm² = 10000 J/m²

Find the maximum HCF length given which can fit into a space of `maxlength` given a core radius `a` and a pulse

of the end mirrors and the nonlinear lens in any windows.
